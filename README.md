# County Cricket Tour Blog:

This blog site is a page that allows lovers of county cricket to come together and share their experiences of the 18 different county grounds.

The live application can be viewed here:

# Purpose and Target Audience:

**Problem Statement:**
County cricket is becoming an under appreciated form of the game with much of the online space taken up by international or franchise cricket. It can be hard for followers of the county game to find a space for a more reasoned, friendly discourse about county cricket specifically.

**Purpose:**
This app will allow people who love and follow county cricket around the country to come together as a community. Share their thoughts on the game and the experience of attending matches. It will also allow for tips about making the most of the different host stadiums.

**Target Audience:**
The target audience is quite simply anyone who loves county cricket.

# Agile

To plan and create this project I used the Agile principles in conjuction with a projectboard on Github. This was the first time I had used Agile as an individual developer rather than as a part of a Hackathon team. However whilst I did not need to assign tasks I still found it useful to set out a plan to work through the project and work towards fulfilling the acceptance criteria of User Stories.

# Design Choices

As the main purpose of this project was the functionality of the site I did not focus too much on the design of the site. However my main aim was for a easy to navigate site that enhanced the user experience and layed out the information of the blog posts in a clear way.

## Colour Scheme

I selected the main colours of the site with cricket in mind. The dark read of the navigation options and page titles was based on a cricket ball. The green of the header and footer the pitch. The backgroudnd white the colours worn during county cricket.

#8B0000 - Dark red for the navigation options and page titles
#56ad56 - Green for the header and footer
